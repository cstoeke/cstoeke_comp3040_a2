## FAQ

### Why is Markdown better than a word processor?  
- Markdown allows for better control that is more widely applicable than typical word processor formats, as well as its simple syntax is quick and easy to learn.

### Why is my resume theme not updating?  
- If you are using a Jekyll-based theme and changing it through the repository settings, it may take anywhere between 5-20 minutes to update. Be patient, refresh the page, and check back later if it's still not updating.
